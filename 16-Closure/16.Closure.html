    <p>
        A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives a function access to its outer scope. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

    <script>
        function a()
        {
            var val = 10; // 
            function increment()
            {
                val++;

            }
            increment();
            return val;

        }
        console.log(a());

    </script>
